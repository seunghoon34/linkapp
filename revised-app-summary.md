# Revised Dating App Summary

1. Matching Process:
   - User A and User B are both actively searching
   - Their preferences match each other
   - They become a "pending link" (similar to Uber matching a rider and driver)

2. Link Preview:
   - Both users get a preview of each other's profile
   - They have 30 seconds to decide whether to continue or break the link
   - If either user breaks the link, both return to searching
   - If both accept, they move to the next stage

3. Locked Chatroom:
   - Users are forwarded to a locked chatroom
   - Each user is limited to sending one message
   - A map is available showing the location of each user

4. Unlocking the Chatroom:
   - Users must meet in person
   - They use Near Field Communication (NFC) by tapping their phones together
   - This action unlocks the chatroom for full communication

5. Location Services:
   - Crucial for the initial matching process
   - Continues to be important for the map feature in the locked chatroom stage
